# Yolov2 tiny tensorflow for Movidius Neural Compute Stick (NCS)

This is a Tensorflow/NCSdk implementation of Yolov2. It was inpired by simo23 repo, see: https://github.com/simo23/tinyYOLOv2.

Credits to him for the functions to load the .weights file and functions to process the outcome of the Network.

I made this repo to make a tensorflow implementation of Yolov2 possible for the Movidius NCS, because until now I've only seen cafe implementations of Yolo for the NCS. 

### How to use it on the NCS
- clone the repo on a linux 16.04 system
- install ncsdk2 and opencv2
- run the following command in the terminal:
```python
python3 Script.py
make run
```
- and done! The output of the network will look something like this:

### How to use it normally / in debug mode
- clone the repo
- install opencv2
- run the following script with python3: 
```python
Script.py
```
- and done! The output should be the same as on the NCS

### Note!
The processing power of the NCS is not as well as 4 titan X (pascal) GPU's, ofcourse. That is why you will get a processing time of ~6Hz / ~170ms, instead of 220Hz like advertised on the Yolov2 page. The biggest lost in preformance is made in conv7 and conv8:

If anybody can help me improve this lost, it would be much appreciated!! Any other sugestions and questions are welcome as well! You can contact me on this repo or at: verhaar.bastiaan@gmail.com

### Future plans
I am planning to program the project furture to make webcames compatible with this project and I have planned to make another repo with a yolov3-tiny implementation
